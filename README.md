# Drone_command_wrapper
A C++ wrapper to command an autonomous vehicle using mavlink protocol via serial port. A network connection check is implemented in wireless_interface_con.cpp

The drone_command_test.cpp file is an experiment I did, feel free to modify it.

        mkdir build && cd build
        make
